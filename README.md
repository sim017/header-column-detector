# header-column-detector
Given a text file which has rows of data Identify if the header column is present or not. 
The hybrid model.experiments with the rule based clustering as well as a machine learning model.
There are many cases in the problem statement where we do not require to apply machine learning models. In place of that it is beneficial to use the rule based models that will help to give simplier results. Thus, the hybrid model uses rule based clustering model for simplier results. The complex decisions are taken by the machine learning model in this case a decision tree to identify if the document has the header present or not. 

The second jupyter notebook can be used to identify which amongst the given text rows is a header row.
